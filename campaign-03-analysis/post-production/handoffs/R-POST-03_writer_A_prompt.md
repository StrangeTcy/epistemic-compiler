Aggregate difficulty comparison:
- Cases with at least one "hard" dimension: PASS=53 FAIL=20 pass_rate=0.726
- Cases with no "hard" dimension: PASS=78 FAIL=42 pass_rate=0.650
- Counterintuitive: cases containing "hard" pass MORE often than cases with no "hard" at all

Within-environment easy-vs-hard pairs (same environment, last dimension flipped easy→hard, all other dims held constant):

Hard PASSES while easy FAILS (counterintuitive — "hard" makes it easier):
- css_state_machine: easy,easy=FAIL | easy,hard=PASS
- compositional_optimizer: easy,easy=FAIL | easy,hard=PASS
- functorial_augmentation: easy,easy=FAIL | easy,hard=PASS
- sheaf_schema_sync: easy,easy=FAIL | easy,hard=PASS
- rd_adaptive_halting: easy,easy,easy,easy,easy=FAIL | easy,easy,easy,easy,hard=PASS

Easy PASSES while hard FAILS (intuitive):
- categorical_lenses: easy,easy=PASS | easy,hard=FAIL
- moco: easy,easy,easy,easy,easy,easy=PASS | easy,easy,easy,easy,easy,hard=FAIL
- monadic_reward: easy,easy=PASS | easy,hard=FAIL
- tensor_functor: easy,easy=PASS | easy,hard=FAIL

Limitations:
- Single provider (atria), text_only input modality
- Campaign paused at provider_error; one case (ts_trajectory__broken_reflective) marked paused_provider_error
- Compile_only verdicts are exploratory, not validated model verdicts
- No confidence intervals; single seed per selected cell
- Partial credit exists: some FAIL verdicts carry non-zero scores (0.95, 0.714, 0.5, 0.417, 0.286, 0.278, 0.208)
- Within-environment pairs only flip the last difficulty dimension; not all dimensions independently varied

REVIEWER BRIEF (accepted Stage A) — key points to respect:

- The strongest defensible thesis is narrow: flipping a difficulty dimension from "easy" to "hard" does not reliably produce a failure. Within the same environment, holding all other dimensions constant, some easy→hard flips cause a pass→fail, some cause a fail→pass, and some cause no change. "Hard" is not a reliable failure predictor.
- NOT defensible: claiming that difficulty dimensions never matter — some easy→hard flips do cause failures (categorical_lenses, moco, monadic_reward, tensor_functor).
- NOT defensible: claiming that "hard" reliably makes tasks easier — the effect is inconsistent across environments.
- NOT defensible: stitching behavioral_reference and compile_only buckets into one aggregate pass rate. Report per bucket only.
- NOT defensible: treating compile_only verdicts as validated model verdicts.
- NOT defensible: general evaluation prescriptions beyond what the evidence supports.
- Tone: remove profanity, stray glyphs, and unsupported mechanistic language.

TASK

Write a complete, independently structured research essay (not an outline, not a summary) for R-POST-03. Lead with a real question or tension: if you dial up "hard," does the model fail more often? Present the within-environment easy-vs-hard pairs as evidence that the answer is no — sometimes hard passes while easy fails, sometimes easy passes while hard fails, and sometimes nothing changes. State exactly what the evidence establishes (the counterintuitive pairs where hard passes but easy fails; the intuitive pairs where easy passes but hard fails; the aggregate showing hard-containing cases pass more often) and what it cannot (no claim that difficulty is irrelevant, no claim that difficulty helps, no causal mechanism for the inconsistency). Embed at least one figure with a caption. Place caveats where needed. Do not imply internal mechanisms. Do not make general evaluation prescriptions beyond what the evidence supports.
